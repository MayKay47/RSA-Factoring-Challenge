# RSA-Factoring Challenge
**RSA** is a widely-used `public-key cryptography algorithm` that is based on the difficulty of factoring large composite integers. In RSA, the security of the key is based on the assumption that it is computationally infeasible to factorize the large composite integer that is used as the modulus in the RSA algorithm.
